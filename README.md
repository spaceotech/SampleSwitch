# SampleSwitch

You have switched before, right?
For turning on the Bluetooth or may be Airplane mode?
Good, because Here, I’ve a created a demo on [How to Add On/Off Button Like Airplane Mode And Bluetooth Using UISwitch](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/uiswitch-example-tutorial/). 

If you face any issue implementing it, you can contact me for help. Also, if you want to implement this feature in your iOS App and looking to [Hire iPhone App Developer](http://www.spaceotechnologies.com/hire-iphone-developer/ ) to help you, then you can contact Space-O Technologies for the same.
